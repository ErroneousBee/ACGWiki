### Create special pages

Create a page that hosts a small quiz, multiple choice on species identification.

ical links in the calandar using webcomponents

### Other website items

Rework the overlay stuff to work cleaner, perhaps only do it in figures of a certain class

Rework menus to behave better, have animations too.
