These are all jobs that can be done in the woods. Some are seasonal events, some are continuous, some will only need doing periodically.


## Control Rhododendron Regrowth

* Get/Update Herbicide Certs.
* Map locations of Rhododendron regrowth.
* Monitor other invasive species, particularly Cherry Laurel.

## Owl Path

This path is becomming overgrown but no activities can be safely done until the dead ash trees removed.

Previous tasks removed trees and scalloped the woodland edges as per the management plan. This needs continuing when it can be safely accessed.


## Pegasus Path ( Scout Land )

This was done Oct 2021, still need to clear sycamore, and maybe return in late 2022.

* Clear encroaching vegetation.
* Remove sycamore from coppiced area.
* Repair sections of corderoy path at seep line.
* Install short sections of corderoy in boggy parts.
* Coppice Hazel.
* Thin Hollies.
* Report unsafe trees.
* Get w3w locations for pond, dog bin, seep line, etc.
* Identify some of the plants in the coppiced area.

## Coppicing Areas

Coppicing increases biodiversity in the woodlands. Possible locations include:

* Scout land border ( badgers ).
* East of McinDoe.
* Along Pine Path.
* Hollies by football pitch.

## Ponds

The ponds are in generally good condition. Pond work is best done in October after a dry summer when water levels are low and many species have become dormant.

* Get advice from experts on maintainence priorities.
* Reduce willows in Alfreds Pond. Borrow a boat to get easier access, and cut/winch them out.
* Deepen Lancaster Pond.
* Maintain Cranston.
* Drain from Alfreds needs rodding.

## Meadow

2021 Mow was very poor, the mower barely cut anything. Need to look at getting this back to a reasonable mow.

* Seek advice on recovering from poor mowing.
* Look into buying scythes. A rough scythe could also be used in the glade.
* Purchase strong cord for bailing.

## Glade

We used to mow this area, it doesnt really grow grass. It does start regererating trees and bramble, which needs to be kept down to maintain this area as a woodland glade.

We could design and install a bench here, and possibly add a musical instrument.

* This areas needs the brambles removed and encroaching vegetation pushed back.
* Map location of Rowan and Alder Buckthorne trees

## Survey

* Identify and record unusual species
    * Tree just down from container ( Grey Willow? )
    * Wild Service by Lake
    * Alder Buckthorn north of meadow
    * Alder buckthorn in glade


# Other tasks

* Identify where paths need closing off or surfacing
* Corderoy in boggy sections where public have been widening paths in the winter.
* Reduce sycamore in coppice areas, it becomes dominant if left unchecked.

# Small Items

* New saw blades ( have plenty hung up in container )
* Print or buy new feet for 13 yellow Salmon litter pickers
* Install new lock furniture on container door ( its in the grey cupboard )
* Print Maps and tasklists for container and entrances. Need printer.
