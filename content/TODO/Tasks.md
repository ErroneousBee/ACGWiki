These are all jobs that can be done in the woods. Some are seasonal events, some are continuous, some will only need doing periodically.

# Invasive Species Regrowth

Generally, we schedule one task per year to visit a section of the woods and dig up any returning rhododendron.

Invasive plant locations are recorded on Mergin Maps. Some locations have a large laurel that needs removing, or a specimen off site is seeding into the woods.

* Schedule yearly task to remove returning plants.
    - Around playing fields, play area, and lake. ///spend.glow.same
    - Area around holtye track and main track ///stale.famous.cheek to ///hats.funds.rates
    - Area between Main Track and Sussex Border Path ///wake.curry.safe
    - Area around top of Badgers ///star.code.fields
    - Lancaster Pond/ McIndoe Path ( generally laurel garden escapees ) ///media.boss.reveal
    
* Holtye Track has some mature laurels that need removing. They are deep in the treeline, you'll need to push through to get to it. ///legal.doors.jungle
* Area around top of main track has lots of small laurels in need of digging out[^gv].

# Owl Path

Dangerous ash trees removed in 2025. Previous tasks removed trees and scalloped the woodland 
edges as per the management plan. This can now continue. 

* Extend and rebuild the corduroy path.
* Scallop path edges

## Pegasus Path ( Scout Land )

This was Coppiced, holly reduced, and corduroy path laid Oct 2021.

General maintenence:
* Clear encroaching vegetation.
* Remove sycamore from coppiced area.
* Install/Maintain sections of corduroy path in boggy parts and below seep lines.
* Coppice Hazel.
* Thin Hollies.
* Report unsafe trees.

## Other Paths

* Suitable for corduroy along Beech Path. ///stray.usage.arrow 
* Suitable for corduroy top of Badgers. Particularly the crossroads. ///dice.adjust.silks
* Sangs Path near Alfreds would benefit from a couple of buckets of MOT in the low spots[^gv].
 
## Coppicing Areas

Coppicing increases biodiversity in the woodlands. 

Possible locations include:
* Scout land border ( top of badgers ).
* East of McinDoe.
* Along Pine Path. ///aspect.hugs.pushed
* Hollies by football pitch.

## Ponds

The ponds are in generally good condition. Pond work is best done in October after a dry summer when water levels are low and many species have become dormant.

* Get advice from experts on maintainence priorities.
* Alfreds Pond needs Willows reduced periodically. Borrow a boat to get easier access, and cut/winch them out.
* Deepen Lancaster Pond. ( Very low priority )
* Cranston has had the canopy removed. 
    - Crome the pond as far as possible to increase depth. 
    - Investigate planting. 
    - Rope swing attracts litter and things thrown in.

## Meadow

An established wildflower area, at risk from improper mowing, particularly since 2020.

The southwest corner has some holes that need filling in, and the bulk of the wildflowers have yet to colonize that area.
The north end could be pushed further into the woods, and again it is yet to be colonized by yellow rattle.
The west side gets encroached by brambles if the mower avoids it. 

2021/2022 Mows were poor or absent. Need to look at getting this back to a reasonable mow.
2024 Mow was with a flail mower, and was impossible to rake up after it was rained upon.
2025 Mow is better. Encroaching bramble was pushed back. Arisings mostly removed. 

* Push back encroaching brambles from all sides[^gv].
* Restore bug hotel[^gv] ( special care to be taken, some glass will be in there )
* Continue monitoring with surveys.
* Strew seeds into uncolonized corners.
* Re-introduce dyers green-weed and possibly other species.

## Glade

We used to mow this area, it doesn't really grow grass. Annual mowing is not required.
It does start regenerating trees and bramble, which needs to be kept down to maintain this area as a woodland glade.

* Periodically brush cut bramble encroaching vegetation, push back trees to North-West[^gv].
* Rowan and Alder Buckthorne trees have been mapped in the area.

## Lake Area

This is a high traffic area. GCN have been recorded in the lake, but recent survveys ( 2023-4 ) suggest newt numbers may be reducing.

* Identify the number of fish in the lake. If high, they will need removing.
* Remove laurels from area between play area and lake. ///future.united.hint
* Remove Laurels from the bushes[^gv] in the center of the play area, and the perimeter hedge. ///lively.home.ships
* Remove Laurels from south bank. ///garden.skins.smooth
* Remove bamboo[^gv] from ///lease.works.wing
* Bottom of steps is often litter ridden as drug users attempt to keep the area uninviting. ///less.crisis.fired

# Surveys

Ashplats has an iNaturalist defined area, so entries in the iNaturalist App automatically become visible for everyone.

Some specific area are worth targeting:
* The Meadow. This is to ensure the mowing regime is correct for the ecosystem.
* Dormice. Want to find out where they are, to inform coppicing schedule.
* Newts. A bellweather of the condition of the lake and ponds.

We are trialing ( 2025 ) some dormouse tunnels to see if we can identify their management requirements.

# Other tasks

* Corderoy in boggy sections where public have been widening paths in the winter.
* Reduce sycamore in coppice areas, it becomes dominant if left unchecked.
    - Scout Land ///shots.cycle.lungs
    - Owl Path ///update.grin.taking
* Block desire paths along ghyyl[^gv] at badgers ( ///never.solved.moment ) and bottom of Pines ( ///daisy.liner.maps )
* Install a cross drain and gully just below the Pines Path seep line. [^gv]
* Drain from Alfreds needs rodding.
* Alfreds could have the live hedge next to the path re-layed[^gv]. Last done 2015ish.
* Yew hedge between lake and house could have non-yew plants removed. [^gv] 

# Installations

Some possible installations we could try

* A hanging xylophone. 2 posts, a rope between them, hang tuned sticks from it.
* Photo location. Slab with a hole to mark where to place camera, get people to upload to a site and animate the result.

# Small Items

* Print or buy new feet for 13 yellow Salmon litter pickers
* Install new lock furniture on container door ( its in the grey cupboard )
* Paint container with anti-climb paint ( have 3 liters in container )
* Get w3w locations for pond, dog bin, seep line, etc.
* Identify where paths need closing off or surfacing
