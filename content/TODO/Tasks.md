These are all jobs that can be done in the woods. Some are seasonal events, some are continuous, some will only need doing periodically.


## Control Rhododendron Regrowth

* Get/Update Herbicide Certs.
* Map locations of Rhododendron regrowth.
* Monitor other invasive species, particularly Cherry Laurel.

## Owl Path

This path is becomming overgrown but no activities can be safely done until the dead ash trees removed.

Previous tasks removed trees and scalloped the woodland edges as per the management plan. This needs continuing when it can be safely accessed.


## Ghyll Steps

The installation of steps and boardwalk has allowed the braiding of paths on the slope to be reduced. 

* Make chestnut risers and stakes. 
* Liaise with MSDC to acquire topping material.
* Replace missing/decaying steps, use side risers to stop side slump.
* Dig out ditches and drains upslope.
* Add topping to worn areas, particularly the lower slope where water erosion and desire paths are forming, and on some boggy sections 1/2 way up.
* Push undergrowth back.
* Consider moving sections that are bypassed by desire paths.
* Plinth is decaying and vandalised.

## Pegasus Path ( Scout Land )

This was done Oct 2021, still need to clear sycamore, and maybe return in late 2022.

* Clear encroaching vegetation.
* Remove sycamore from coppiced area.
* Repair sections of corderoy path at seep line.
* Install short sections of corderoy in boggy parts.
* Coppice Hazel.
* Thin Hollies.
* Report unsafe trees.
* Get w3w locations for pond, dog bin, seep line, etc.
* Identify some of the plants in the coppiced area.

## Coppicing Areas

Coppicing increases biodiversity in the woodlands. Possible locations include:

* Scout land border ( badgers ).
* East of McinDoe.
* Along Pine Path.
* Hollies by football pitch.

## Ponds

The ponds are in generally good condition. Pond work is best done in October after a dry summer when water levels are low and many species have become dormant.

* Get advice from experts on maintainence priorities.
* Reduce willows in Alfreds Pond. Borrow a boat to get easier access, and cut/winch them out.
* Deepen Lancaster Pond.
* Maintain Cranston.
* Drain from Alfreds needs rodding.

## Meadow

2021 Mow was very poor, the mower barely cut anything. Need to look at getting this back to a reasonable mow.

* Seek advice on recovering from poor mowing.
* Look into buying scythes. A rough scythe could also be used in the glade.
* Purchase strong cord for bailing.

## Glade

We used to mow this area, it doesnt really grow grass. It does start regererating trees and bramble, which needs to be kept down to maintain this area as a woodland glade.

* This areas needs the brambles removed and encroaching vegetation pushed back.
* Map location of Rowan and Alder Buckthorne trees

# Other tasks

* Remove tree guards from Ambulance Station hedge
* Identify where paths need closing off or surfacing
* Corderoy in boggy sections where public have been widening paths in the winter.
* Reduce sycamore in coppice areas, it becomes dominant if left unchecked.

* Print or buy new feet for 13 yellow Salmon litter pickers
