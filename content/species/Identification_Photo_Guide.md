# How to take useful Identification Photos

- Create a clear image.
    - Move back and use a small amount of zoom.
    - Support the camera on a bag, tripod or anything handy.
    - Use high ISO and small aperture.
    - Light it well. Use a reflector or diffuse light source, avoid flashes.
- Fill the frame. 
- Clear the area. Remove debris from around a specimen to avoid autofocus picking the wrong target.
- Hold/support it in position using hand or other support.
- Note an accurate location, date, and time of record ( take a reference pic using mobile phone if using an SLR ).
- Use a scale object. Coins, tools, fingers in the shot can help show size.
