In 2015 Mid Sussex District Council took out a 125 year lease on most of the East Court Estate and are responsible for maintenance and upkeep.

If you have an issue with any of our trees, please [contact MSDC](/#Contact) who manage the woods on our behalf.

Please help us protect the woodland and wildlife by being considerate in the woods.

Dog walkers are always welcome.

 * Please keep your dogs under control and on a lead if necessary.
 * It is an offence not to clean up after your dog.
 * Please do not throw dog faeces into the undergrowth, or stamp it into the ground. Bag it and remove it.
 * Dog bins are situated near the main entrances to the woodland.

Do not light fires or BBQs in the meadows. Meadow areas are sensetive to fires destroying live plants and the seed bank stored in the top layer of soil.
 
Take your litter home with you. Many thanks to the dog walkers, and others, who pick up other people’s litter.
  
Cycling and camping are not allowed in the woods.
  
Please do not put down food for foxes or other animals.

Do not fly tip garden waste in the woods, it brings in invasive plants, and can become a home for rats.
