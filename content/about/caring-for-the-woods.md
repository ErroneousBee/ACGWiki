Please help us protect the woodland and wildlife by being considerate in the woods.

Dog walkers are always welcome.

 * Please keep your dogs under control and on a lead if necessary.
 * It is an offence not to clean up after your dog.
 * Please do not throw dog faeces into the undergrowth, or stamp it into the ground. Bag it and remove it.
 * Dog bins are situated near the main entrances to the woodland.

Do not light fires or BBQs in the meadows. Meadow areas are sensetive to fires destroying live plants and the seed bank stored in the top layer of soil.
 
Take your litter home with you. Many thanks to the dog walkers, and others, who pick up other peopleâ€™s litter.
  
Cycling and camping are not allowed in the woods.
  
Please do not put down food for foxes or other animals.

Do not fly tip garden waste in the woods, it brings in plants that can be invasive, and can become a home to rats and other vermin.
  
The park and woodlands are managed by Mid Sussex District Council and are subject to Local Authority Bylaws. The site is regularly patrolled by the MSDC Park Rangers. 

Please report any problems to MSDC on 01444 477392 or email:rangers@midsussex.gov.uk
