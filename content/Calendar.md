# Task Information

Tasks are announced by email, and on Facebook one week before the event. [Contact us](/#Contact) to be added to the email list.

We generally meet at the [green container](https://w3w.co/outer.vest.swim) at 10am on the 2nd Sunday of the month and begin with a safety briefing.
We will aim to finish at around 3pm, but many volunteers leave early or arrive late due to family commitments,

[Nearest car parking ](https://w3w.co/rare.taxi.task) is by the pavilion / children's play area.

Please bring a drink and refreshments with you and wear appropriate clothing and sturdy footwear.
We have gloves available for those that need them, and hand tools are supplied. 
Some volunteers prefer to bring their own gloves and tools.
